Installation Instructions for the Dream Software
------------------------------------------------

-> Windows 

Necessary software: 

* Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (minimum requirement: Service Pack 5 / recommended: Service Pack 5 
  with Processor Pack 5 or Service Pack 6). 
  http://www.microsoft.com/

  Trolltech QT 2.x.
  http://www.trolltech.com/
  ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/non-commercial/QtWin230-NonCommercial.exe

OR

* Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition that is free (also install the
  Microsoft Platform SDK).
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/

  Q../Free for Windows
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtwin/

  Use Q../Free for Windows 3.3.4-3 that is available from here:
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/qtwin/qt-win-free-3.3.4-3-src.tar.bz2?download
  (to compile Q../Free with Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition read this
  tutorial: http://qtwin.sourceforge.net/qt3-win32/compile-msvc-2005.php ).

  http://drm.sourceforge.net/download/ProjectExpress2005.zip is a zip file that contains
  the project files for compile with Visual C++ Express Edition the libraries that are needed.

OR

* For information about how to compile Dream with MinGW read this document
  http://217.35.80.115/mediawiki/index.php/Building_on_Windows_with_Mingw

The following libraries are needed: 

* FFTW: Download the sources from http://www.fftw.org and create a static library libfftw.lib 
  with the fftw and rfftw sources (FFTW version 2.x has to be used!). Copy this library 
  together with the header files dfftw.h and drfftw.h in the drm/libs directory (We prepared 
  Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project files for building this library and the compiled library 
  with all necessary header files in http://drm.sf.net/download/WinFFTWInst.zip ). 
  
* QWT: Download the sources from http://qwt.sourceforge.net and create a static library 
  libqwt.lib with the sources. Copy this library together with all header files from the 
  include directory in the drm/libs directory (We prepared Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project 
  files for building this library and the compiled library with all necessary header files in 
  http://drm.sf.net/download/WinQWTInst.zip ). 
  
* FhG IIS Journaline Decoder: Download http://drm.sf.net/download/WinFhGJourLib.zip and 
  create a static library libfhgjournaline.lib with the sources. Copy this library together 
  with all required header files in the drm/libs directory (The file WinFhGJourLib.zip 
  contains the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project files for building this library and the 
  compiled library with all necessary header files). 

* FreeImage: Download the sources from http://freeimage.sourceforge.net and create a static 
  library FreeImage.lib with the sources (Make sure to change the code generation to 
  multithreaded DLL!). Copy this library together with the header file FreeImage.h in the 
  drm/libs directory (We prepared the compiled library with all necessary header files in 
  http://drm.sf.net/download/WinFreeImageInst.zip).
  With Qt3 or Q../Free for Windows Freeimage is not needed, but in this case is required
  the zlib library (a compiled version for Windows is available from here:
  http://www.zlib.net/zlib123-dll.zip ).


* FAAD2: Download the sources from http://www.audiocoding.com and create a static library 
  libfaad.lib with the sources. IMPORTANT: Make sure to define the macros DRM and DRM_PS! 
  Copy this library together with the header file neaacdec.h in the drm/libs directory.
  A version of FAAD2 that works with the Dream software can be downloaded here 
  ( http://drm.sf.net/download/WinFAAD2Inst.zip ). Use the project file 
  faad2/libfaad/libfaad.dsw to compile the sources and copy the library together with the 
  header file (which is located in faad2/include) in the drm/libs directory. 

* FAAC: Download the sources from http://www.audiocoding.com and create a static library 
  libfaac.lib with the sources. IMPORTANT: Make sure to define the macro DRM! Copy this 
  library together with the header files faac.h and faaccfg.h in the drm/libs directory.
  A version of FAAC that works with the Dream software can be downloaded here 
  ( http://drm.sf.net/download/WinFAACInst.zip ). Use the project file 
  faac/libfaad/libfaac.dsw to compile the sources and copy the library together with the 
  header files (which are located in faac/include) in the drm/libs directory.
  An experimental version of FAAC implementing the 960 transform length is available here 
  ( http://drm.sf.net/download/WinFAAC960Inst.zip ) 

* Hamlib: Download the latest release from hamlib project file list and unzip the files. 
  Copy all .dll-files from hamlib/bin either in the drm/windows or your Windows system folder. 
  Copy the directory hamlib containing the header files from hamlib/include in the drm/libs 
  directory. Copy the .lib-file from hamlib/lib/msvc in the drm/libs directory and rename 
  it to libhamlib.lib (We prepared a zip-file containing all necessary files in 
  http://drm.sf.net/download/WinHamlibInst.zip ). 

Dream installation:
- Before compiling the Dream sources call the batch file MocGUI.bat in the drm/windows 
  directory to create the QT moc-files. 
- Load the project file drm/windows/fdrm.dsw in your Visual C++ and compile the sources. 

 
-> Linux 

Install devel packages of Trolltech QT 2.x or 3.x.
http://www.trolltech.com/
 
> These are some source RPMs which are needed to compile the Dream software: 

You need fftw, install at least the RPM and the devel RPM. 
http://www.fftw.org/

You need to install the QWT RPMs (QWT and QWT-devel). 
http://qwt.sourceforge.net/

You need to compile and install faad2 (no binaries here due to licensing problems). 
http://www.audiocoding.com/

Source RPM for fftw                  http://drm.sf.net/download/fftw-2.1.3-8.src.rpm
Source RPM for QWT                   http://drm.sf.net/download/qwt-4.2.0-1.src.rpm
Source RPM for faad2 (DRM only)      http://drm.sf.net/download/faad2-2.0-1drm.src.rpm
                                     (not compatible to Dream version >= 1.1)

Dream installation:

- Type sh bootstrap from the drm directory. That script will prepare system configuration 
  detection's scripts. An Autoconf version 2.50 or higher is required for this script. If the 
  bootstrap file is missing, skip this step. 
  
- Type ./configure from the drm directory. That script will determine how your system is set up, 
  and figure out how to compile Dream. 
  
- At this point you can choose the type of sound interface you intend use. The standard setting 
  is OSS. To activate the ALSA sound interface, type 
  ./configure --enable-alsa.
  For more help type ./configure --help.
  To enable Journaline, Hamlib and Freeimage libraries, type 
  ./configure --with-journaline --with-hamlib --with-freeimage
  (these libraries are disabled by default). 
  
- Type make from the drm or drm/linux directory.
