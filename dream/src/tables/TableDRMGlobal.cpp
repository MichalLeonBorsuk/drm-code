 * Alexander Kurpiers said:
 * If you look at table 47, you can calculate the FFT size.
 * E.g. for mode A: at 48kHz 24ms (T_u) is 1152 samples. Thus the FFT size
 * is 1152. And you see this is correct: 48kHz/1152=41 2/3Hz, which is the
 * carrier spacing. For another sample rate you would of course get another
 * FFT size.
