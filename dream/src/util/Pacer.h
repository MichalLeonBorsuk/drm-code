 * Description:
 *
 *  This defines a concrete subclass of CPacketSink that writes to a file
 *  For the moment this will be a raw file but FF could be added as a decorator
 *  The writing can be stopped and started - if it is not currently writing,
 *  any packets it receives will be silently discarded
 *
