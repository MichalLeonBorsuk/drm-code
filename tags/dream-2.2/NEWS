The Dream development team today releases Dream version 2.2.

Dream is a DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) software receiver and decoder.
It is a very complete receiver, featuring compliant decoding of HE AAC v2
audio streams, journaline decoding, a feature rich statistics section
providing invaluable information about the streams being received, and automatic
update of available stations from the web, among several other features.

It also features a limited transmission mode, that uses the FAAC AAC encoder.

Dream is multi-platform and has been tested on OSX, Win32 and Linux.

Changes since version 2.1:

  - Added support for fdk-aac v2
  - Added support for modern compilers
