Dream is a DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) software receiver and decoder.
It is a very complete receiver, featuring compliant decoding of HE AAC v2
audio streams, journaline decoding, a feature rich statistics section
providing invaluable information about the streams being received, and automatic
update of available stations from the web, among several other features.
 
It also features a limited transmission mode, that uses the FAAC AAC encoder.
 
Dream is multi-platform and has been tested on OSX, Win32 and Linux.
 
We would like to welcome David Flamand to the developement and administration
team. David is the main driver behind this release which completes our migration
to modern supported 3rd party libraries. David has many more ideas for new features,
some of which we will see very soon.

The binaries are compiled without support for AAC decoding or encoding.
 
On windows, if you want to hear the audio of a DRM broadcast you will need to obtain a 
copy of faad2_drm.dll and place it in the same directory as the dream.exe file. 
 
Instructions for building faad2_drm.dll and faac_drm.dll are available at drm.sf.net. 
 
If you want to control a SW Rig you will need additional hamlib dlls. 
 
These are available at www.hamlib.org. 
 
On linux the procedure is similar and libfaad2_drm.so and hamlib .so files will be needed.
 
Have fun with dream
